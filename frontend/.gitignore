# Placeholder for future build artifacts or local dependencies
# For now, we are using CDNs, so this might not be strictly necessary.
# However, it's good practice to have it.

# Example: Ignore node_modules if we were to use a local package manager
# node_modules/

# Example: Ignore build output if we had a build process
# dist/
# build/
